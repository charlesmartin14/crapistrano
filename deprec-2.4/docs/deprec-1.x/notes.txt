# Building Edge Capistrano
You can build an edge gem by cd'ing to that directory and doing:

1. svn info. Find the line that says "Revision:" and mark the revision number.
2. rake PKG_BUILD=<rev> gem. Replace <rev> with the revision number.
3. Look in the pkg subdirectory. Install that gem file via "gem install pkg/<gem file>"
